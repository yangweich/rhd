This is a plugin that controls
a sabertooth 2x12 motorcontroller
and two 12bit magnetic encoders (AS5045)
in the end of the motor axle.

The control is through an arduino-nano
board.
The firmware for the arduino nano is
in the arduino subdirectory.

The arduino nano implements a implements
a simple velocity P-controller with feed forward.

The magnetic encoder AS5045 is on the
motor axle and interfaced using PCI.
The sabertooth is controlled using RC pulse-width
i.e. 1-2 ms pulses (repeated every 10ms).

The encoder is read about 20 times each 10ms, and
filtered by a median filter every 5 reads.
The 12 bit encoder is extended by 3 bit to a total
of 15 bit (repeating itself every 8 rotations of the motor)

The control of the motor velocity is in
encoder tics each 10ms. so a value of 2000 is max speed 
forward (about 1/2 rotation every 10ms, or 50Hz or 3000RPM).
-2000 is max speed reverse.
The motor is rated to about 2500RPM, but tested on 27V to about 3000RPM.

Motor commands are possible, -500 (full reverse) to
 +500 (full forward), corresponding to
a change from 2000us to 1000us pulsewidth to each of the wheel
motors.

An emergency stop, and "remove to start" will be implemented
on the arduino and also available from the plugin.

The arduino Makefile has an "make install" to the
board using AVDdude command (using STK-kit).
